# Git

- ## Git is an open source distributed version control system

### Which means we can go **back** in time

- To work on a different version of our code base and work with branches.
- **Distributed** means we have remote repository so that everyone could have a full copy of the codebase and download it to a local repo.

## Remote repo

- Used for backup and/or for team work

## Local repo

- Has 3 stages
  - Working area - files on work run
  - Staging area - files to be committed
  - Committed area - files which had been committed

## Git settings

> After installing `git` set the git configurationas follows
>
> `git config user.name "<user-name>"`
>
> `git config user.email "<user-e-mail>"`
